"""
Implementation of methods for network-based KDE based on the paper

Okabe A, Satoh T & Sugihara K (2009). 'A kernel density estimation method for networks, 
its computational method and a GIS‚Äêbased tool', International Journal of Geographical 
Information Science, 23:1, 7-32

The intention is that this should be used in conjunction with the ITNStreetNet
class defined elsewhere, which implements network construction and processing.

Given such an object, and a number of points for which the positions on the network
have been found by the relevant methods, these tools can be used to perform network
KDE calculations.

    '''
    The equal split kernel function
    
    NOTE: This version assumes the network contains no cycles of length <2h, as
    in the paper.
    
    The class is initialised by passing the following:
        - an ITNStreetNet class
        - a set of points (kernel centres) whose locations on the network have
        been found. This should be specified as a dictionary, indexed by a unique
        point_id (can be anything as long as it does not clash with FID of street
        network featues) and where every item is (closest_edge,dist_along), as
        found by the closest_segments_euclidean() method.
        - a kernel bandwidth h
        - a univariate kernel function
    
    As soon as the class is initialises, a new network object g_aug is built. This
    graph is exactly the same as the street network, but with a node added for every
    kernel centre. That is, the original edges are split whenever a kernel centre
    appears, with a node (of degree 2) inserted. The node label is the same as the
    point_id.
    
    The reason for doing this is that is makes the task of finding all kernel centres
    within h of a given network point much easier - we can use classical network
    search methods which grow trees out of the source point in question.
    
    The evaluation of the kernel is then fairly trivial. There are two possibilities:
        - evaluation at one of the kernel centres (likely use in SEPP)
        - evaluation at any other point
        
    The first case is dealt with by evaluate_point(). You take the source point
    and do a depth-limited shortest path search on g_aug. Considering only the
    target nodes that are kernel centres, you then know all kernel centres within h
    of the source, plus the distances, plus the shortest paths needed to get there.
    It is then trivial to pass these to the kernel function and adjust the result
    for the degrees of the intermediate nodes (all the extra nodes we added make no
    difference because they are degree 2).
    
    The second case is slightly more complicated. A temporary new node 'EVAL_POINT_NODE'
    is created in the relevant position on g_aug. That is not as easy as it could 
    be, because the position is specified before we started messing around with the
    network by adding extra nodes etc. So in some cases we have to find where it
    falls relative to the new kernel centre nodes. Once that has been done, it is
    (almost) as trivial as the first case to do the evaluation.
    
    In the SEPP case, I imagine it would be used as follows:
        - Initialise this class with all possible points
        - Perform a points_within_bandwidth operation for each one, and store the
        results - distances, and degree sequence of intermediate nodes - in a lookup.
        - Whenever we need to evaluate at a given point, use the above lookup,
        including only those points classified as background (or whatever) at any
        point
